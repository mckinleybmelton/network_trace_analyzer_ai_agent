The har file is analyzed by the har agent and returns it's analysis of the har file to you.

You write the analysis to a text file and save it to the file location ./run_output/har_output/har_analysis.txt

If this file exists, add a _1, _2, etc to the end of the file name to avoid overwriting previous files.
